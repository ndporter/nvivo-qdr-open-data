# Using QDR with NVivo

## Description

This pilot curriculum focuses on using NVivo effectively with the Qualitative Data Repository (QDR) and is part of a wider collection of new open qualitative data curriculum under development with support from an Institute of Museum and Library Services National Leadership Grant. The curriculum provides step-by-step models and guides for effective workflows to find and reuse qualitative and mixed methods data archived at QDR in NVivo projects, as well as best practices to prepare your own NVivo projects and data for archiving and reuse at QDR.
