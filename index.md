This lesson provides step-by-step models and guides for effective workflows to find and reuse qualitative data archived at QDR in NVivo projects, as well as best practices to prepare your own NVivo projects and data for archiving and reuse at QDR.

::: Prerequisites

It is helpful, but not required, to be familiar with basic principles and practices in qualitative research, such as open and thematic coding. No experience with qualitative software (including NVivo) or QDR is necessary.

:::

We will annotate, analyze, and prepare to archive interview transcripts from a qualitative study of abortion reporting, focused on how participants decide whether to allow sharing data they provide on sensitive topics. Neither the original study nor this lesson proposes to draw conclusions on the political, legal, or moral aspects of abortion.

The [original study](https://doi.org/10.1177/10497323211054058) concluded that not all participants fully understood the concept of data sharing and thus may not be able to give fully informed consent.

In the lesson, we will use the data to explore to what extent concerns identified about "fully informed consent" are also relevant to research on less sensitive topics. To do so, we will reanalyze a portion of the data, compare our coding to the original study's coding, and use both traditional and data analytic methods to draw a tentative conclusion before packaging our own work to archive and share for other researchers.


::: Callout

## Workshop format

This lesson is designed to be delivered as an in-person or synchronous online workshop, with an experienced instructor demonstrating techniques and helpers available to assist anyone with questions or errors in real time. For best results in live workshops, we encourage you to attempt to complete steps with the instructor and use the methods provided by the instructional team to ask for help when needed. Making mistakes and encountering challenges is part of every learning process.

The lesson is also, however, complete and usable for fully self-paced online learning. When working through the lesson online, we recommend reading all callouts and notes, as well as attempting all exercises and checking your results against the provided solutions, although in some cases, there are alternative approaches that work equally well.
