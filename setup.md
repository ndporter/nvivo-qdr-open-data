## Software Setup

This lesson requires access to [NVivo software][nvivo] for Windows or Mac. We recommend using NVivo 14 or NVivo Release 1 (also known as NVivo 13), but users of older versions should be able to perform most actions with minimal modification. No cloud or platform-specific features are required.

Prior to installing NVivo for the first time, you will need to set up a Lumivero account by clicking the **Free Trial** button at the top right of the [NVivo homepage][nvivo]. After creating an account and downloading the software for your operating system, please sign into the software to validate your license, which will allow you full access to the software for 14 days.

## Paid Licenses and Free Alternatives

Before investing time in this training, recognize that NVivo is paid software which requires a valid license to use past the trial period. Depending on your status (student, academic, etc.) you may be eligible to purchase one or both of the following:
- perpetual licenses: never expire but only provide access to the current version and more expensive
- annual licenses: less expensive and may include upgrades but cease working after one year

Open source and freely licensed tools like [Taguette][taguette] or spreadsheets can provide useful and economical alternatives to paid software in some circumstances and we encourage you to investigate your options before purchasing software. Future lessons will include training in free alternatives.

We do not endorse any particular software, but provide training in widely used coding and qualitative analysis software.
